        The history and beginning of Bhayandar Syro-Malabar Community started in 1980, when small gatherings of around
        30 families who settled In Bhayandar, Mira Road and Kashimira areas, began coming together for meeting their
        spiritual and social needs. The community became active with the support from Our Lady Of Nazareth Church,
        Bhayandar West.<br>

        On 28th September, 1984 Rev. Fr. Chelsius C.M.I. Celebrated a Malayalam Qurbana In the Syro-Malabar Rite for the
        community at Our Lady Of Nazareth Church.

        In 1985, Malayalam Qurbana was started on every second Sunday and this continued till 1988.The Keralite priests
        from Shalini Bhavan, Sion and K.C.A. Bhavan, Kalina, Santhacruz came for administering the Holy Eucharist and
        the Liturgical needs of the Community. In 1988, the size of the Syro-Malabar community of Bhayandar grew to 80
        families. On 1st September, 1988 the Bhayander Sacred Heart Church was formed. Rev. Fr. Varghese Nadackal was
        the first vicar of the Church.</p>

          <p>
            On 1st August, 1990 the community began the efforts to build own prayer hall under the leadership of the
            then
            Vicar Rev. Fr. Jose Ainickal. In 1992, with the mercy of God Almighty and with the help of well-wishers and
            under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Davis Pullikkottill and Our Lady Of Nazareth Church authorities, the
            community
            could buy a plot of 13 guntas In Bhyandar East. On April 30th, 1992 His Excellency Mar Paul Chittilapilly
            the
            First Bishop of Kalyan diocese laid the foundation stone for the Bhayander Sacred Heart Catholic Welfare
            Centre.
            At this time the parish was divided into four zones and further divided Into 15 family units.

            In 1997, Rev. Fr. Joseph Pothenparampil, M.S.T. took charge as the Parish Priest. A Committee of 64 members

            Excellency M
            ana, consecrated the Sacred Heart Church. Bhayandar. On, the same day the Bhayandar Sacred Heart Welfare
